I choose to create a data set with 10 observation.
The x variable is uniform distributed with a min value at 0 and 1 as max.
the error term is normal distributed with a zero mean and a variance equal to one.

```{r}
x1<-runif(10, 0,1) 
e<-rnorm(10, 0, 1)
y<-x1+e
```

The linear regression for one predictors variable can been written as:
$\hat{Y}=\beta_0+\beta_1 X_{i,1}+\epsilon_i$  where $i=1,...,n$

We can also write the linear regression in matrix form as:
$\hat{Y}=\beta_0+X\beta_1+\epsilon_i$

The X matrix is defined as a $2*10$ matrix, the matrix looks following:
$$
\begin{bmatrix} 
1 & x_{1,1} \\
1 & x_{1,2} \\
\vdots  & \vdots \\
1 & x_{1,10} \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

and the Y is defined as a $1*10$ matrix, the matrix looks following:
$$
\begin{bmatrix} 
1 & y_{1} \\
1 & y_{2} \\
\vdots  & \vdots \\
1 & y_{10} \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$


Therefore my X matrix looks following:
```{r}
X<-cbind(rep(1, length(x1)), x1)
```

```{r,echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
library(MASS)
library(boot)
library(grid)
library(neuralnet)
library(ISLR)
library(MASS)
library(xtable)
library(nnet)
library(plyr)
```
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0.130 \\
1 & 0.376 \\
1 & 0.298 \\
1 & 0.187 \\
1 & 0.717 \\
1 & 0.125 \\
1 & 0.228 \\
1 & 0.510 \\
1 & 0.654 \\
1 & 0.484 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$
and the transpose for the matrix is:
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1\\ 
0.130 & 0.376 & 0.298 & 0.187 & 0.717 & 0.125 & 0.228 & 0.510 & 0.654 & 0.484\\
\end{bmatrix}
$$
The Y matrix is following:
```{r}
Y<-cbind(y)
```
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
-0.986 \\
-0.395 \\
0.863 \\
-0.795 \\
0.325 \\
-0.377 \\
0.633 \\
0.065 \\
1.271 \\
2.457 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

If we choose to use the least square estimation to estimate the cofficient, we can write the formula as:
$\hat{\beta}=(X^{T}X)^{-1}X^{T}Y$

The first part can be written as:
```{r}
B<-solve(t(X)%*%X)%*%t(X)%*%Y
```

the cofficient for the data is:

$$
\left[ \begin{array}{c} \beta_0 \\ \beta_1 \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{c} -1.202 \\ 3.379 \end{array} \right]
$$

The $$\beta_0$$ is constant term, which mean it do not change when x changing. $$\beta_1$$ is depending on the x value, in this case when x increase the prediction is also increasing. So the prediction is depending on both of this cofficient, The prediction matrix is:
```{r}
pred<-X%*%B
```


$$\left[ \begin{array}{c} 1.016 \\ 0.178 \\ 1.217 \\ -0.195 \\ -0.371 \\ -0.683 \\ 1.732 \\ 1.961 \\ 1.283 \\ 0.855 \end{array} \right] = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0.130 \\
1 & 0.376 \\
1 & 0.298 \\
1 & 0.187 \\
1 & 0.717 \\
1 & 0.125 \\
1 & 0.228 \\
1 & 0.510 \\
1 & 0.654 \\
1 & 0.484 \\
\end{bmatrix} \times \left[ \begin{array}{c} -1.202 \\ 3.379 \end{array} \right]  $$

Therefore we have a prediction for our data set, if we choose to plot these observations and also use make a line for the prediction it will looks following:

```{r}
plot(x1, y, main="OLS prediction")
lines(x1, pred, col="red")
````

as we can see in the plot above that non of the observation is perfect fit at the prediction line. If we choose to take each of the observation minus the prediction

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
